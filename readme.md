# Flower cow

The flower cow is a cow that spreads flowers everywhere it goes. It turns dirt into grassy dirt, empty space into grass, and grass into flowers. It can be bred and tamed with grass. If you have the bonemeal mod, it can be bred with bonemeal, mulch, or fertilizer.

The flower cow spawns naturally, but rarely. Only 1 in 10 cows is a flower cow. Flower cows must be found; they can not be bred from cows.
